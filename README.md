## **🎮 How to Use**
### **1️⃣ Viewing Available Quests**
- Run the command:
  ```sh
  /quests
  ```
- A **selection window** appears, showing **5 random quests** (rotating every 5 minutes).
- If you have an active quest, it **remains selected** while 4 others change.

### **2️⃣ Completing a Quest**
- Track progress via the **scoreboard** (updates live).
- Fulfill the quest objectives:
  - **Kill Targets:** Kill the required entities.
  - **Gather Items:** Pick up or collect required materials.
- Once completed:
  - **Reward is granted**
  - **Quest progress resets**
  - **Scoreboard updates**

### How the Jump Puzzle Works
1. A player generates a puzzle using `/jumpgen`.
2. The puzzle is enclosed with walls and a light-emitting base.
3. Players must jump across blocks that are generated to be challenging but solvable.
4. A tracking system monitors when a player starts and completes the puzzle.
5. Upon completion, the player receives 100 credits via EconomyAPI.
6. Once completed, the user is teleported to the center and the puzzle regenerates
7. If puzzle is imposible, use the green block to regenerate it. Stay on it more than 5 seconds
